# MotionAnimation
Repository for displaying animations of various kinds.

Typically, it is assumed that these animations originate from the solutions of
some kind of differential equation systems, so continuity is usually
guaranteed.

The REPO has this functionality implemented in
    - PYTHON (./PY)
    - MATLAB (./M)
    - C++ (./CPP)

Besides the animation functionality, I have also implemented the drawing of
some common structures (based mostly on source code from other folks). This can
be used along with the animation function to get richer visualizations
